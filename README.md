# ffl0-C

This is the fflo continuous cellular automata concept implemented in C, which I've also written in Rust and Go.  I've included 'crusher.mov' with the source code as an example of fflo's output. Check respond.c to see the keystroke controls. You can use between 1 and 10 filters. Fewer is often better. You can also individualize randomize filters, which helps to zero in on interesting patterns. I hope to add a 'save parameters to file' feature as I've done with the Go and Rust versions.
